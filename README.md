# CS50 - Computer Science Introductory Course by Harvard

## What will I see here?
Here you will see some of the exercises and laboratories that I had to develop along the course. There are somethings in C, somethings in python and some other stuff, but the main idea is to introduce some concepts about computer science.

## About the course
The portuguese (BR) version of the course was brought by Fundação Estudar. The CS50 is one of the most famous introductory courses of computer science in the world, and is given to the Harvard students on it's first semester.

## Exercises and labs
Every module of the course has it's content plus exercises and a laboratory practice.  
The exercises are divided in "easy" and "challenge", the easy ones are supposed to be done with the basics learned on the classes of each module, guiding the student to figure our the solution by itself.  
The challenging ones are meant to push a little further of what was introduced in class, asking the student to dig a little more into logic.  
The laboratory is just an exercise to practice exactly what was learned, in order to help with memory.
